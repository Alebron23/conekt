Map to allow users to share videos

This is a project that I am working on to allow users to share videos based on location. It is a work in progress and I have only put the google map on the page so far, which was a little harder than I thought. I did this using an npm module called react-google-maps. It uses a higher order component to display the map on the screen and at the time I was not familiar with HOCs. I had to do a lot of reading about HOCs and other concepts that I was introduced to, like mixins, decorators, genorators and context binding to understand how the map was working. It took me down a wormhole but in the end it helped strengthen my knowlodge of React and other programming concepts. Here is a screenshot of the map.
